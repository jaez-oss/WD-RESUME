## Overview



The project showcases artist Jae's resume profile. Its purpose is to impart the background
of the artist; their education, experiences, skills, portfolio, and where they can be in touch.

One of the key components of the project is that the header buttons allow the user to browse to the parts they want to view despite being a single page website.

HTML and CSS were utilized to make the website functional. CSS holds the majority of the website design while HTML serves as the backbone, holding majority of the content of the website.

The website is best viewed when zoomed in 100%.
### Key Components

- Single Page Website

### Technology

![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)


## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
